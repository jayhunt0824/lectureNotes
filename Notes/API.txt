First we need a URL, where we grab our data. 

const baseURL="";

we need to make sure when the user 

for Space X EXAMPLE, reaching out to Space X. we have a form and a button. 

declare variable for searchForm.
const searchForm = document.querySelector('form');
const spaceShips =document.querySelector('ul');//where the spaceships from api will show up

our search form needs an event listener. waiting for someone to click. 

searchForm.addEventListener('submit', fetchSpace); //fetchspace is the callback function that will happen when the submit button is clicked. 

function fetchSpace(e){
    e.preventDefault(); //preventing submit action from occuring. 

    fetch(baseURL)//built in function, do not have to define. 
    .then(result=>res.json()) //.json also returns a promise because there could be a lot of data being processed. 

    use another .then because its another promise.
    .then(json=>console.log(json)) //delete console log later and log line below
    .then(json =>{ //not concise with => bc we have a couple lines of code. 
        console.log(json);
        displayRockets(json) //function that gets passed the json array. gets invoked in this line.
    })
}

function displayRockets(rockets){
    rockets.forEach(r=>{    (//r stands for a single rocket object)
        let rocket=document.createElement('li');
        rocket.innerText=r.name;
        spaceShips(unorderedList).appendChild(rocket) //rocket is our child element. 

    }) //forEach bc rockets is an array
}
